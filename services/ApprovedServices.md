This file tracks services that exist in `src/rakkib/data/registry.yaml` and their validation status.

Status meanings:
- `Implemented and tested`: committed, pushed, synced to `runtime`, and validated on the test server.
- `Implemented, pending testing`: registry/templates/hooks exist, but the service has not yet completed the current test-server validation flow.
