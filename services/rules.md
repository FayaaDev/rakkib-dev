# Service Addition Rules (Rakkib)

This is the checklist for adding any new service to Rakkib.

## Service Tracking Flow

1. Check `PendingServices.md` first.

If the requested service is listed there, use that entry as the implementation source and remove it only after the service is fully implemented and test-server validated.

2. Check `ApprovedServices.md` before implementing.

If the service is already marked `Implemented and tested`, do not reimplement it unless the user explicitly asks for changes. If it is marked `Implemented, pending testing`, prioritize validation and update its status only after the test-server flow passes.

3. Implement, test, then approve.

After successful implementation, commit to `main`, push `main`, sync `runtime`, validate on the test server, then move or update the service in `ApprovedServices.md` as `Implemented and tested` with concise validation notes.

## Non-Negotiables

1. Use the `rakkib-add-service` skill

Follow the workflow in `.opencode/skills/rakkib-add-service/SKILL.md`.

2. Test on the test server (service-targeted bare-metal path)

All newly added services MUST be deployed and verified here:

`sshpass -p 'z45rdKUe' ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new root@174.138.183.153`

`192.168.0.235` (Fayaalink) is not a validation target. Never test, deploy, or run the service-validation workflow on that host.

Use the dedicated project subagents for this validation work:
- `RakkibTester1`, `RakkibTester2`, and `RakkibTester3` run test-server validation.
- Assign one service/bead to one tester at a time. The test server is resource-limited; do not run concurrent validations.
- Tester agents are validation-only. They must report command evidence and blockers, but must not edit files, update `ApprovedServices.md`, close beads, commit, or push.
- The primary agent is responsible for interpreting tester output, updating repository files, closing beads, committing, and pushing after validation passes.

Minimum validation steps:
1. `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FayaaDev/Rakkib/main/install.sh | bash`
2. `rakkib add <service> --yes` or `rakkib add --service <service> --yes`
3. Continue with the service-specific verification steps below

Do not run `rakkib init` or full `rakkib pull` for normal new-service validation. Test one service at a time:
1. `rakkib add <service> --yes` or `rakkib add --service <service> --yes`
2. Check the service container/host process and logs
3. `rakkib smoke <service>` for browser-facing services
4. `rakkib remove <service> --yes` and confirm cleanup removes rendered artifacts, declared data, and service Postgres resources when declared
5. Re-add with `rakkib add <service> --yes` to prove removal did not leave stale state
6. Re-run `rakkib remove <service> --yes` after successful validation so the tested service is not left running on the test server
7. Move to the next service only after the public or internal HTML smoke check passes and the validated service has been removed

Do not treat local runs as proof.

After test-server validation passes, update `ApprovedServices.md` in the same work item. Services must not be marked approved before add, smoke, remove, re-add, and any applicable internal-mode checks pass.
Services must not remain deployed on the test server after a successful validation unless the user explicitly requests that they stay up.

## Required Implementation Shape

- Add a service entry to `src/rakkib/data/registry.yaml`.
- Add the service to `src/rakkib/data/questions/03-services.md` so the interview catalog, numeric aliases, subdomain examples, and placeholder mapping stay aligned.
- Add templates under `src/rakkib/data/templates/` (as needed):
  - `docker/<service>/.env.example`
  - `docker/<service>/docker-compose.yml.tmpl`
  - `caddy/routes/<service>.caddy.tmpl`
- Add hooks only when required (use `src/rakkib/hooks/services.py`).
- Prefer declarative registry fields and existing shared hooks. Do not add service-specific Python branches unless the behavior cannot be expressed through registry/templates/hooks.
- Keep registry `env_keys`, generated secrets, compose `${VAR}` references, and `.env.example` files consistent.
- Browser-facing Docker services should declare `internal_access` for internal exposure mode unless they are explicitly Cloudflare-only or unsupported in internal mode.
- Services that mount `/var/run/docker.sock` or otherwise control the host must call that risk out in registry `notes` and user-facing descriptions.
- Keep `rakkib add` behavior correct:
  - selectable in the UI
  - deploys cleanly
  - deselection fully purges service resources

## Current Lifecycle Commands

- `rakkib pull --service <service>` validates the targeted pull path without running the full services pass.
- `rakkib add <service> --yes` and `rakkib add --service <service> --yes` add one service non-interactively.
- Checkbox `rakkib add` is authoritative sync: unchecked services are removed, not merely ignored.
- `rakkib sync-services` applies the saved service selection without a full pull; the browser setup flow uses it after service selection changes.
- `rakkib remove <service> --yes` is the non-interactive removal path and must update state so later pulls do not re-add the service.
- `rakkib restart <service>` must work when a service declares restart hooks or render-sensitive artifacts.
- `rakkib web --lan` exposes the setup UI on the LAN with a tokenized URL; do not assume web setup means public Cloudflare exposure.
- `rakkib auth` is the current sudo/Docker access validation command. Do not document a sudo subcommand unless it exists.

## Exposure Modes

- `exposure_mode: internal` is the default private/LAN mode. Caddy routes, Cloudflare tunnel setup, and DNS publishing are skipped.
- Internal browser-facing services need `internal_access.enabled: true`, a unique `host_port`, a correct `container_port`, and optional `scheme`, `path`, or `compose_service` when needed.
- In internal mode, Rakkib injects the direct LAN port into compose only for services with `internal_access`; avoid hardcoded `ports:` for browser-facing Docker services unless there is a concrete reason.
- `exposure_mode: cloudflare` publishes explicit service hostnames through Caddy and Cloudflare.
- Smoke checks must use the correct URL for the active mode: LAN URL for internal mode, public HTTPS URL for Cloudflare mode.

## Acceptance Checks (Required)

- Service appears in `rakkib add` selection and can be selected.
- Installer-first validation followed by `rakkib add <service> --yes` or `rakkib add --service <service> --yes` deploys the service cleanly.
- `rakkib pull --service <service>` works when validating the targeted pull path.
- Cloudflare mode renders and validates the Caddy route when the service is browser-facing and public.
- Internal mode skips Caddy/Cloudflare and publishes the registry-declared direct LAN port when the service supports internal access.
- Browser-facing services declare registry `smoke.path` and `smoke.expected_text`, and `rakkib smoke <service>` passes with GET.
- Deselect/remove path works through checkbox `rakkib add` and/or `rakkib remove <service> --yes` (containers down, artifacts removed, Postgres resources dropped if declared).
- `rakkib sync-services` applies saved selection changes without a full pull.
- `rakkib restart <service>` works when restart hooks or render-drift behavior apply.
